 on GitHub.
 
 ### Setup
- First, open your config.json
- Add in your token and prefix that you would like the bot to listen for
- Set the default activity for the bot

### Installation

- Zeus 2.0 requires Node.js 6.0.0 or newer to run.
- Ignore any warnings about unmet peer dependencies, as they're all optional.
- Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd zeus2
$ npm install
$ node .
```

FYI - I dont really have time to support this bespoke bot, but just create an issue if you have one.
